# Product Management owner decisions

PM-03A separated source-resolved behavior from decisions that only a Product
Management owner could authorize. PM-03B now records the ten explicit final owner
decisions. Source evidence, PM-03C observations, owner approval, implemented
contract metadata, and runtime enablement remain distinct.

| Decision ID | Topic | Question | Technical evidence | Current safe behavior | Required owner decision | Impact if unresolved | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PMD-001 | Create New Account | How should `PackageHid(Product)` be represented without inventing an unverified destination? | Canvas writes selected Add-Ons to `PackageHid(Product)`; PM-04 verifies the exact `" , "` serialization and confirms SQL insert, `Detail`, approvals, and VSTS omit it. | Typed multi-value Portal concept; legacy compatibility destination is SharePoint only. | `APPROVE RECOMMENDATION`: no invented destination. | No remaining contract blocker; runtime remains separately disabled. | RESOLVED_BY_OWNER |
| PMD-002 | เพิ่ม Email เข้า Account | What is the canonical email multiplicity and validation? | Legacy raw text has inconsistent multi-email grammar; history confirms multiple values. | Validated email array; trim and validate each item; adapter-only compatibility serialization. | `APPROVE RECOMMENDATION`. | Removes ambiguity from the Portal contract. | RESOLVED_BY_OWNER |
| PMD-003 | เพิ่ม Email(พนักงาน) เข้า Account | Which Thailand route is effective? | The ordered Home `If` reaches `Form1_103` first; the later identical condition targeting `Form1_6` is unreachable. | Preserve `Form1_103` contract. | None. | None for contract mapping; stale source should not be treated as a second behavior. | RESOLVED_FROM_SOURCE |
| PMD-004 | เพิ่ม App เข้า Account | What is the exact all-Roles `Detail` fragment? | `Filter` gets all Account roles; `Concat(..., role & ", ")` plus `Left(...,-2)` removes the final delimiter; empty source returns `""`; no sort/dedup/escape. | Preserve this derived fragment in the contract; submission remains disabled. | None. | None for contract mapping. | RESOLVED_FROM_SOURCE |
| PMD-005 | ขอสิทธิ์เข้า Role / เพิ่ม App เข้า Role | What authority does Matrix have? | Matrix proves candidate visibility only. | Candidate/lookup source only; never entitlement, approval, access, or Manager-authority proof. | `APPROVE RECOMMENDATION`; Phase 1 retains Legacy Teams approval only. | Prevents Matrix observations becoming authority. | RESOLVED_BY_OWNER |
| PMD-006 | ขอสิทธิ์เข้า Role / เพิ่ม App เข้า Role | How must Active, Manager failure, duplicates, and ordering behave? | Legacy applies no Active filter/guard/sort/distinct. | Active=true only; unknown Active fails closed; unusable Manager is UNRESOLVED; stable key required for duplicates; ordering has no approval meaning. | `APPROVE RECOMMENDATION`. | Establishes deterministic fail-closed candidate policy. | RESOLVED_BY_OWNER |
| PMD-007 | เพิ่ม App เข้า Role(พนักงาน) | Must at least one App be selected? | Legacy guards do not require App; historical App ID/App Name drift exists. | App is REQUIRED and must resolve to a valid App candidate for new Portal requests. | `APPROVE RECOMMENDATION`. | Removes empty Add App intent. | RESOLVED_BY_OWNER |
| PMD-008 | เพิ่ม Permission เข้า Role | What delimiter does `featureList` use? | The runtime does not parse a list: one required text value is appended unchanged after `List Feature : ` and passed through `Detail`. | Model as raw text with no enforced delimiter. | None. | None for legacy-compatible contract mapping. | RESOLVED_FROM_SOURCE |
| PMD-009 | เพิ่ม Package Add On | Must Phase 1 preserve the overloaded fields? | End-to-end source evidence confirms both mappings. | Preserve Customer Role -> `ProductName(Product)` and Add-On -> `AppName(Product)` at the compatibility boundary. | `APPROVE WITH CHANGE — LEGACY COMPATIBILITY FIRST`. | Keeps Phase 1 behavior while documenting overload. | RESOLVED_BY_OWNER |
| PMD-010 | Create New Role | What delimiter does `featureList` use? | One required text value is appended unchanged after `List Feature : `; no parsing or normalization occurs. | Model as raw text with no enforced delimiter. | None. | None for legacy-compatible contract mapping. | RESOLVED_FROM_SOURCE |
| PMD-011 | เปลี่ยน Provider | Should Phase 1 preserve Provider -> `RoleName(Product)`? | PM-04 verifies dropdown -> `RoleName(Product)` -> unchanged SQL `RoleName`, plus the same provider meaning in `Detail`/VSTS; no override exists. Historical downstream samples remain absent. | Preserve the technically verified owner-approved compatibility mapping. | `APPROVE WITH CHANGE — LEGACY COMPATIBILITY FIRST`. | Keeps the exact Legacy field reuse without redesign. | RESOLVED_BY_OWNER |
| PMD-012 | Tranfer Owner | Should Transfer Owner preserve Provider -> `RoleName(Product)`? | PM-04 verifies dropdown -> `RoleName(Product)` -> unchanged SQL `RoleName`, plus the same provider meaning in `Detail`/VSTS; no override exists. | Preserve the technically verified owner-approved compatibility mapping. | `APPROVE WITH CHANGE — LEGACY COMPATIBILITY FIRST`. | Keeps the exact Legacy shape without inventing a Provider field. | RESOLVED_BY_OWNER |
| PMD-013 | Tranfer Owner | What does the Email field mean? | Existing field/label is `Email ลูกค้า`; PM-04 verifies raw text is carried only in `Detail` -> SQL `Detail` -> approval/VSTS, not SQL `Email_Customer`; no identity authority is proven. | Retain Customer Email semantics; do not rename to `newOwnerEmail` or derive ownership/identity authority. | `APPROVE WITH CHANGE — LEGACY COMPATIBILITY FIRST`. | Prevents false identity inference while preserving the exact Detail-only transport. | RESOLVED_BY_OWNER |
| PMD-014 | ลบ User | What delimiter does `emailList` use? | One required text value is appended unchanged after `List Email : `; no split, trim, validation, or normalization occurs. | Model as raw text with no enforced delimiter. | None. | None for legacy-compatible contract mapping. | RESOLVED_FROM_SOURCE |
| PMD-015 | เปิด/ปิดแจ้งเตือน | Is Detail-only transport acceptable for Phase 1? | `เปิด`/`ปิด` is carried through `Detail`; no dedicated typed destination was found. | Retain Detail-only Legacy representation; modernization is separate. | `APPROVE WITH CHANGE — LEGACY COMPATIBILITY FIRST`. | Preserves behavior without inventing activation. | RESOLVED_BY_OWNER |

## PM-03B historical-evidence effect

The offline 77-record historical extract corroborates PMD-008, PMD-010, and
PMD-014: sampled `List Feature`/`List Email` content behaves as raw text, including
embedded newline evidence for `List Feature`. This is corroboration, not a new
list grammar. Historical label drift (`Role` / `Role Name` / `Role Internal`,
`Role Name` / `Product Name`, and older `App Name` / `App ID`) does not select an
authoritative compatibility mapping. The bounded latest-five samples also do not
justify changing any source-confirmed `MULTIPLE` field to `SINGLE`.

Historical observation alone closed no owner decision. PMD-003, PMD-004, PMD-008,
PMD-010, and PMD-014 remain `RESOLVED_FROM_SOURCE`; PM-03B subsequently applies
the separately supplied owner approval to the other ten decisions.

Open owner questions: **0**. Owner-resolved decisions: **10**. Source-resolved
decisions: **5**.

PM-03C adds authorized privacy-minimized legacy SQL aggregate evidence and safe
recommended decisions without changing any status. See
[Product Management policy closure evidence](product-management-policy-closure.md).

PM-03D packages the ten OPEN questions, evidence, recommendation, alternatives,
compatibility boundary, owner response, and possible post-approval effect in the
[Product Management Owner Decision Pack](product-management-owner-decision-pack.md).
The controlled workflow is PM-03A -> PM-03C Evidence -> PM-03D Owner Decision
Pack -> Owner Approval -> PM-03B Apply Decisions. This PM-03B application records
the supplied approvals but does not activate submission or integration.

## PM-04 technical verification effect

PM-04 changes no owner decision, category, validation policy, or approval
authority. It closes only the three technical downstream evidence blockers from
the committed offline Canvas and Flow exports. The resulting registry is
`13 CONFIRMED / 0 PARTIAL`; all 13 schemas still have
`submissionEnabled=false`, the real adapter remains disabled, and Production
integration is not implemented.
